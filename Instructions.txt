CREATE TABLE movies
(
  movieid character(100) NOT NULL,

External library used to parse html and fetch records jsoup-1.8.2.jar.

These two jars must added in library and build project.

Once all imports are resolved navigate to Tools -> Services -> Servers -> Apache Tomcat -> Right click and start server.

Open below url in browser.
http://localhost:8084/IBMDBScrapper/Imdb.jsp

Please note: When you run this for first time it takes time (3 to 5 min depending on Internet speed)
This is because onload it is trying to hit website to get details of all movies and store in database.
This can be optimized by not fetching details on load but instead on some button click.
